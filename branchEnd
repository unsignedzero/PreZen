Perhaps this is a silly commit but nevertheless learning about the generator
pattern and applying it was a fun, but also painful process. In the act of 
creating and using the above pattern, I've also implicitly used the facade 
pattern, and decorate pattern and perhaps others to.

It was a painful but very education three days for most of the code edits.
I also learned a lot more with VIM and got a little more insight on how JS 
works with objects. In any event, like the file name suggests this is an end
for this branch and unless any other generator experiments are made, no
updates will be merged into or out of this branch.

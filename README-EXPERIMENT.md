# PreZen JS EXPERIMENT #

Contained here are notes of interest for the experiment branch.
These will be merged into the development branch as needed.

## JSH ##

Like C/C++, I will create .h files for my js, called jsh. These files are not
meant to be read by the browser but by coders as well as dOxygen. As dOxygen
does not explicitly support Javascript, any complex code must be commented out.
This prevents the code from being run but ensures that dOxygen can work 
correctly.
